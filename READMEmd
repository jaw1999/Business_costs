## Data Model and Calculations
### Equipment and Consumables
The core data entities in the system are `Equipment` and `Consumable`. Each equipment item has the following key attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the equipment
- `category`: The category of the equipment (e.g., platform, payload, sensor)
- `name`, `description`, `manufacturer`, `modelNumber`: Descriptive information about the equipment
- `acquisitionCost`: The cost to acquire the equipment
- `monthlyMaintenanceCost`: The estimated monthly cost to maintain the equipment
- `operationalCosts`: Details about the operational costs, including personnel, power, and additional expenses
- `quantity`: The total quantity of the equipment
- `inUse`: The number of equipment items currently in use
- `degradation`: Parameters related to the degradation of the equipment, including type, maximum value, current value, replacement cost, and degradation rate
- `personnelRequired`: The number of personnel required to operate the equipment

The `Consumable` entity has the following key attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the consumable
- `type`: The type of consumable (e.g., helium, gas)
- `name`: The name of the consumable
- `enabled`: Whether the consumable is currently in use
- `unitsPerUse`: The number of units consumed per usage
- `unitCost`: The cost per unit of the consumable
- `stockLevel`: The current stock level of the consumable
- `minimumStock`: The minimum stock level required for the consumable
- `reorderPoint`: The stock level at which a new order should be placed

### Cost Calculations
The system calculates various cost-related metrics:

1. **Total Equipment Cost**: The sum of the acquisition cost of all equipment items.
   - Equation: `totalEquipmentCost = Σ(equipment.acquisitionCost)`

2. **Operational Cost**: Calculated as 10% of the acquisition cost, with a degradation factor applied to increase costs as the equipment degrades.
   - Equation: `operationalCost = equipment.acquisitionCost * 0.1 * (2 - equipment.degradation.currentValue / equipment.degradation.maxValue)`

3. **Maintenance Cost**: Calculated as 5% of the acquisition cost, with a degradation factor applied to increase costs as the equipment degrades.
   - Equation: `maintenanceCost = equipment.acquisitionCost * 0.05 * (2 - equipment.degradation.currentValue / equipment.degradation.maxValue)`

4. **Total Personnel Cost**: Calculated as the sum of the personnel required for all equipment items, multiplied by an assumed cost of $5,000 per person per month.
   - Equation: `totalPersonnelCost = Σ(equipment.personnelRequired) * 5000`

### Inventory Management
The system uses the following calculations to manage consumable inventory levels:

1. **Average Daily Usage**: Calculated based on the usage history over the last 30 days.
   - Equation: `averageDailyUsage = Σ(recentTransactions.quantity) / 30`

2. **Safety Stock**: Calculated to cover 2 standard deviations of demand during the lead time.
   - Equation: `safetyStock = ceil(sqrt(calculateVariance(recentTransactions.quantity)) * 2 * sqrt(leadTimeDays))`

3. **Reorder Point**: Calculated as the average daily usage multiplied by the lead time, plus the safety stock.
   - Equation: `reorderPoint = ceil(averageDailyUsage * leadTimeDays + safetyStock)`

4. **Optimal Order Quantity**: Calculated using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula, which takes into account the annual demand, ordering cost, and holding cost.
   - Equation: `optimalOrderQuantity = ceil(sqrt((2 * annualDemand * orderingCost) / (consumable.unitCost * 0.2)))`

### Degradation and Maintenance
The system predicts equipment degradation and maintenance needs based on the following calculations:

1. **Degradation Rate**: Calculated based on the equipment's degradation type (cycles, hours, or time) and the corresponding degradation rate.
   - Equation: `degradationRate = (usage.cycles || 0) * equipment.degradation.degradationRate` (for cycles)
   - Equation: `degradationRate = (usage.hours || 0) * equipment.degradation.degradationRate` (for hours)
   - Equation: `degradationRate = (usage.days || 0) * equipment.degradation.degradationRate` (for time)

2. **Days Until Maintenance**: Calculated based on the remaining value, the degradation rate, and a 25% maintenance threshold.
   - Equation: `daysUntilMaintenance = floor((equipment.degradation.currentValue - equipment.degradation.maxValue * 0.25) / degradationRate)`

3. **Estimated Maintenance Cost**: Calculated as 5% of the acquisition cost, with a degradation factor applied to increase costs as the equipment degrades.
   - Equation: `estimatedMaintenanceCost = equipment.acquisitionCost * 0.05 * (2 - equipment.degradation.currentValue / equipment.degradation.maxValue)`

4. **Maintenance Priority**: Determined based on the number of days until maintenance is required (high priority for less than 7 days, medium for less than 30 days, low for more than 30 days).

### Combination Optimization
The system provides optimization recommendations for equipment combinations based on the following factors:

1. **Utilization Efficiency**: If the utilization of an equipment item is less than 60%, the system suggests reducing the quantity.
   - Equation: `utilizationScore = equipment.inUse / equipment.quantity`

2. **Maintenance Timing**: If an equipment item requires high-priority maintenance, the system suggests scheduling maintenance.

3. **Alternative Equipment**: The system checks for alternative equipment items that may be more cost-effective, based on acquisition cost and degradation status.
   - Equation: `alternativeCost = bestAlternative.acquisitionCost`
   - Condition: `bestAlternative.acquisitionCost < equipment.acquisitionCost * 0.8`

### Procurement Planning
The system generates a procurement plan based on the following logic:

1. **Equipment Needs**: The system checks for equipment items that require immediate replacement due to high-priority maintenance needs, and adds these to the procurement plan.

2. **Consumable Needs**: The system checks the stock levels of consumables and adds new orders to the procurement plan when the stock level falls below the reorder point.

3. **Priority Scoring**: The system assigns a priority score to each procurement need, with high priority for low stock levels and critical maintenance needs.

4. **Budget Allocation**: The system allocates the available budget to the procurement needs, starting with the highest priority items until the budget is exhausted.

## Assumptions and Limitations
The following assumptions and limitations are made in the current implementation:

1. **Consumable Base Cost**: The system assumes a base cost of $100 per unit for all consumables.
2. **Personnel Cost**: The system assumes a fixed cost of $5,000 per person per month for personnel-related costs.
3. **Degradation and Maintenance**: The system uses a simplified model for equipment degradation and maintenance, focusing on the key parameters without considering more complex factors.
4. **Combination Optimization**: The optimization process is based on a limited set of factors and may not capture all the nuances of real-world equipment combinations.
5. **Procurement Planning**: The procurement planning algorithm assumes a fixed budget and does not consider more advanced procurement strategies or dynamic budget adjustments.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements to the Staff for Dummies system include:

1. **Advanced Cost Modeling**: Incorporating more detailed cost factors, such as energy consumption, labor rates, and variable maintenance costs.
2. **Predictive Maintenance**: Developing more sophisticated degradation models and predictive maintenance algorithms to optimize maintenance scheduling.
3. **Combination Optimization**: Expanding the optimization process to consider additional factors, such as operational requirements, redundancy, and mission-critical priorities.
4. **Procurement Optimization**: Implementing more advanced procurement strategies, including dynamic budget allocation, lead-time considerations, and supply chain optimization.
5. **Integrated Reporting and Dashboards**: Enhancing the reporting and analytics capabilities to provide more comprehensive insights and decision-support tools for managers.

## Conclusion
The Staff for Dummies application provides a comprehensive solution for managing equipment, inventory, and procurement processes within an organization. By leveraging advanced calculations and optimization techniques, the system helps to ensure cost-effective utilization of resources, timely maintenance, and efficient procurement planning. As the organization's needs evolve, the system can be further enhanced to provide even greater value and support the decision-making process.
